## NEAT For EvoJAX.

EvoJAX is a hardware accelerated library for neuroevolution algorithms made in JAX. The task here was to develop Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies algorithm which is compatible with EvoJAX so that we can make it play neural slime volleyball.
The code here is pretty straighforward, and is made by implementing the WANN experiment that was done at Google Brain Tokyo and making it compatible with EvoJAX. This repository can be PR to the EvoJAX library, and NEAT can be a base algorithm in the EvoJAX library.

We had to train an agent to play Neural Slime Volleyball in the EvoJAX environment. I've highlighted some key areas throughout the code, so navigation is quite easy.
